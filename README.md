###img2mif
***
**Image to .mif file converter for use in Altera Quartus FPGA development.**
	
Converts images to Altera Memory Initialization File (.mif) format.
	
How to use:</br>
	Pass the image, width in bits of the memory, the depth of the memory, how many bits per pixel for the memory, and color format. Color format is either 0 for Grayscale or 1 for RGB.
	RGB color will set the RGB elements of a pixel as consecutive memory locations. 
		
		img2mif -width -depth -bpp -color
		
		width : Width of memory in bits. Only support for 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 at the moment.
		depth : Depth of the memory structure. Only valid choices are 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288.
		bpp : Bits per pixel of the output. Uses basic thresholding to truncate image data.
		color: Set to 0 for auto RGB output. Set to 1 for grayscale.

		EX : img2mif tester.bmp 8 8192 2 1

If the image is too large for the memory it will fill up as much of the memory as possible then give a warning.
If the image does not take up all the space the other locations will be filled with 0.

So far RGB is currently not implemented and a couple sections are untested but should work. Seems bitmaps are the best choice as file inputs. 
Uses the [stb image library] (https://github.com/nothings/stb) for opening up images and getting the pixel data. Included is a copy of stb_image.h that I used for building.
